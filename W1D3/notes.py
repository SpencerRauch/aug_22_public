#FOUR PILLARS

#Encapsulation
#we group code together into classes /objects

#Inheritance
#ability to create subclasses
#child classes get attributes and methods from parents
# call super().__init__() to run parents constructor and give child
# all attributes and methods of the parent

#Polymorphism literally means : many forms
#over-ride? Allows child classes to behave uniquely
#rewrite methods that the parent has by defining a method with the same name in the child
#can use super() to call on parent's original methods
 
#Abstraction
#Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation, and we can hide attributes or methods that a Barista doesn't need to know about, like a CoffeeM. That way the Barista can make a cup of coffee in a simpler manner.
